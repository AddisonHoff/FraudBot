Sanjay, Jeff asked me to write you to introduce you to Gerald Chan, the
brother of Ronnie Chan (ENE director). Gerald has been investing in capital
ventures in the US and Asia for many years. Of late, he has been running
into companies in which Enron is investing or is interested in investing, and
Jeff met with him today to discuss this. Jeff suggested that Gerald contact
you to discuss further. I have provided Gerald with your telephone numbers,
address and e-mail address. You should expect to hear from him shortly.
