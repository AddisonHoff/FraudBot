# FraudBot
The FraudBot 2000 applies a sentiment analysis API to a few emails from the Enron email corpus and outputs if it's positive or negative.

Run main.java to analyze emails.
It is probably neccessary to change the file path of the sample emails in main.java so it reads them correctly on your computer.
The API is limted so if it throws an error this might be the cause.
